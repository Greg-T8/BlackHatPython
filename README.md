# Black Hat Python  

This repository is my collection of learnings from reading the book [Black Hat Python, Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-2nd-Programming/dp/1718501129/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GQ7M73C3AA8G&keywords=black+hat+python&qid=1653296529&sprefix=black+hat+python%2Caps%2C78&sr=8-1). I am working this book daily to catch up to speed on the basics of Python usage with offensive security techniques in mind.
